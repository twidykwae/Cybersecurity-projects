### ðŸŽ¯ Project 1
- **Goal:** Identify phishing emails in `.pcap` files and find the malicious actor.
- **Tools Used:** Wireshark, SMTP filters, TCP Stream Analysis
- **How I Did It:**  
  Used Wireshark filters like `smtp contains "FROM"` across all pcap files. Found high SMTP traffic in `C.pcap`, followed TCP streams, and identified malicious content in the emails.
